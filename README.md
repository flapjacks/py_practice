py_practice
===========
Practice problem sets solved in Python 2.7. I started this project to help gain a more in-depth understanding of Python and practice figuring out the programmatically most efficient way to accomplish a task. Doing is the best way to learn.

Each file is one problem or problem set. Information about each problem can be found at the top of each file.
